# Application To Date My Daughter

<p>This <a href="https://oalva-rez.github.io/git-application-form/">application form</a> was an exercise to practice CSS and HTML fundamentals.</p>
<p>I learned how to use proper HTML semantics such as fieldset and legends. I used a variety of input and label elements to solidify my understanding of their corresponding attributes. </p> 
<p>I practiced positioning elements using CSS without the use of flexbox or grid. </p>
<p>I implmented version control using Git.</p>
